### **Value Types vs. Entity Types in C#**

**Value Types** (e.g., `int`, `string`, `bool`) are directly stored on the stack and are immutable. When you assign a value type to a variable, you create a copy of the value.

**Entity Types** (e.g., classes) are reference types, meaning they store a reference to the actual object on the heap. This allows for multiple variables to refer to the same object, which can be both beneficial and problematic.

**Using Records for Value and Entity Types**

C# `record` types provide a concise way to define both value and entity types. By default, `records` are immutable, making them ideal for value types. However, you can selectively make properties mutable in entity types using `get; set;`.

**Example: Value Type (Address)**

```csharp
public record Address(string Street, string City, string ZipCode);
```

**Example: Entity Type (User)**

```csharp
public record User
{
    public int Id { get; init; }  // Identity, should be immutable
    public string Name { get; set; }  // Mutable
    public Address Address { get; set; }  // Mutable
}
```

**Summary**

| Feature | Value Type (Value Object) | Entity Type (Entity) |
|---|---|---|
| Type | `record` | `record` |
| Immutability | Full immutability | Selective immutability (e.g., Id is immutable) |
| Equality | Compared by value (property-based) | Compared by identity (ID-based) |
| Mutability | Fully immutable | Mutable properties (except identity) |
| Use Case | Simple value objects like Address, Money, etc. | Complex objects with lifecycle, like User, Order |

**Key Points**

- **Value Types:** Immutable, compared by value, suitable for simple data structures.
- **Entity Types:** Mutable (can have mutable properties), compared by identity, suitable for complex objects with a lifecycle.
- **Records:** Provide a concise syntax for defining both value and entity types.
- **Selective Mutability:** Use `get; set;` in entity types to make specific properties mutable.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Equality:** For entity types, ensure that equality is based on identity (e.g., a unique ID) rather than value.
- **Performance:** Consider the performance implications of immutability and reference types, especially in scenarios with frequent object creation or modification.
- **Domain-Driven Design:** Align your choice of value and entity types with your domain model and the specific requirements of your application.

By understanding these concepts and best practices, you can effectively use value and entity types in your C# applications to create well-structured, maintainable, and efficient code.
